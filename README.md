Graphi(t) is a user-friendly software for creating and visualizing 3D parametric plots with ease. It offers a range of features for defining functions, customizing plot settings, and adding multiple curves. Empower your mathematical exploration with Graphi(t)!

## Features

- Intuitive interface for defining parametric functions
- Adjustable time range for precise control over the plotted interval
- Iteration capability for dynamic function evaluation
- Additional variable support for enhanced flexibility
- Save and load functionality to store and retrieve plots

## Installation
